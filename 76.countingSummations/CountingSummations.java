/**
 * It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:
 * 4 + 1
 * 3 + 2
 * 3 + 1 + 1
 * 2 + 2 + 1
 * 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
 * 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
 * 
 * How many different ways can one hundred be written
 * as a sum of at least two positive integers?
 * -----------------
 * My first thought is to create a map with the integers from 1 to n as the
 * key, and the value is the number of ways to write the sum using positive
 * integers. I should be able to use the previous values to build up new values.
 * 
 * If I knew the combinations for n-1, it might be easier to add the rest
 * for n.
