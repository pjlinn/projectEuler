Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.


How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?


Solution:
Didn't use java for this, tried to think through it. Came up with a SUPER
convoluted solution where I summed the possible moves from each spot based
on the spots it could reach...Anyway it worked, but was so unnecessary,
you can just do 40 choose 20. Oh well...
