	Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a 
	square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

	37 36 35 34 33 32 31
	38 17 16 15 14 13 30
	39 18  5  4  3 12 29
	40 19  6  1  2 11 28
	41 20  7  8  9 10 27
	42 21 22 23 24 25 26
	43 44 45 46 47 48 49

	It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom 
	right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 
	numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 
	8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

	If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square 
	spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
	what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes 
	along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

	---------------
	Solved it finally...I had the correct algorithm for the longest time
	but I wasn't using the write variable type. I had floats and ints, but
	I needed doubles as I wasn't generating enough primes. Stopped working
	around ~12%, kept getting row 5229...

	It's pretty fast though, checks minimal numbers
