This is code that attempts to solve Project Euler problems and other practice problems that I find.

			Project Euler
==================================================
MultiplesOf3And5 (Problem 1):
	Multiples of 3 and 5: Problem 1 Project Euler

	If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are 
	multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of 
	these multiples is 23.

	Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

EvenFibonacciNumbers(Problem 2):
	Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by 
	adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, 
	the first 10 terms will be:
		=> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
	By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose 
	values do not exceed four million, find the sum of 
	the even-valued terms.

LargestPrimeFactor (Problem 3):
	The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

	What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

==================================================
		Recursion Practice
==================================================
SumDigits
	Write a recursive method called sumDigits to return the sum of 
	all of the digits in a given integer value.  Use a helper method 
	if necessary.

	Example tests:

	assertEquals(0, sumDigits(0));
	assertEquals(8, sumDigits(1331));  1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8
	assertEquals(16, sumDigits(14641)); 1 + 4 = 6 + 4 + 1 = 16
